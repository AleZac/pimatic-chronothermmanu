#Pimatic ChronoTherm
Manual thermostat plugin for the Pimatic

![alt tag](https://github.com/AleZac/pimatic-chronotherm/blob/master/screenshot/ChronoThermManu.png)

This is the same version of ChronoTherm but I have eliminated all the automatic part leaving only the manual mode.
For information, read the readme of the ChronoTherm plugin

###Configuration
To include the plugin in pimatic add the device to plugin section with...
```
{
  "plugin": "chronothermmanu"
},
```
then add device to config.json
```
{
  "id": "room",
  "class": "ChronoThermDevice",
  "name": "Room",
  "realtemperature": "$switch.manuTemp",
  "interval": 240,
  "showseason": false,
  "offwintemp": 4,
  "offsummtemp": 31
}
```

###WEB INTERFACE

When the border of ***The blue circle*** is ***green*** the valve variable is true
